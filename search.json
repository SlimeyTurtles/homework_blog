    "text": "3 Questions Homework\nWe are supposed to have 3 questions prepared about writing essays. Then we go into breakout rooms and ask each other the questions. If our questions weren’t answered, we can ask them again when we go back to the main room.\n\n\nUnion strike\nIt’s going very bad for them. They are working harder to meet the demands of the students and acting as counselors when schools are supposed to buy counselors, which they refuse to. They are also not getting paid in comparison to rising inflation and the high prices of the bay area. Teachers feel uncomfortable acting as a counselor because they aren’t trained professionals, despite the fact they will do the best they can for the students.\nThe amount of students also are increasing without teachers being compensated. My class went from 18 –&gt; 20 students, but with multiple sections, that can equate to significantly more students per teacher. That means teachers can give students less individual time, and it takes longer for grading/discussions.\n\n\nHow the strikes can play out\n\nThe teachers stop working until the demands are met (unlikely)\nThe teachers stop working during half the week like Monday Wednesday only (more probable)\n\n\n\nTenor faculty vs. Lecture faculty\nTenor faculty is “permanently hired” whereas lecture faculty can be terminated at any time. What the administration could do is get the tenor track faculty and the lecture track faculty to fight each other, where the tenor faculty looks down on lecturers and lecturers are envious of tenor faculty. However, this has not happened and they’re all friends.\nTenor faculty works on a levels system, where the longer you work, the higher of a position you get. In the bay area, its 180k/year to be economically comfortable. However, highest paid of the tenor faculty are not being paid that much (more than 100k, but no where close to 200k).\nFor lecturer faculty, they are supposed to be awarded service salary increases (SSI), which are annual increases in pay every year. However, in the fine print, it is only awarded when the administrative staff agrees upon it. Professor Borland, who has worked at SFSU for 20 years, has never received an SSI. (He made 40k in level 2???)\nIf you have never received an SSI in 6 years, you can apply for another pay increase.\n\n\nProfessor Borland’s living conditions\nHe makes 40k/year in the bay area, and lives because his rent is cheaper than half of what the landlord would typically pay. This has been going on for many many years.\nThe union is asking for 12% pay increase, which 12% increase of 40k is 44k/year. This is no where close to 180k to buy a house in the bay area. (Hes literally been below the poverty line)\n\n\nAnswering questions\nHow do you speak with a natural tone when you use slang?\n\nDon’t worry about it too much when writing for CSUs, but when in a formal setting, write more formally\n\nHow do you grab the readers attention?\n\nYou can ask a questions because thinking about the question makes the reader engaged\nYou can use a shocking statistic to grab the readers attention\n\nHow do you seamlessly transition from quotes?\n\nRead the pocket style manual lol\n\nI’ve always wondered why do instructors ask for a minimum page essay or a minimum word per essay/writing?\n\nBecause CSUs think that more words equate to a better writer, but Drew disagrees because a better written paper is more important than more words\n\nHow do you write a conclusion without repeating what you said in the introduction or thesis?\n\nTheres no point because it’s improbable that the reader forgot what the thesis they read 5 minutes ago was"

    "text": "Due by the start of class on Thursday, 9/7\n\nHave you ever been puzzled or confused by something about essay writing, or writing in general? Now is your chance to find out answers to your questions!\n\nI struggle a lot with the flow of a paper and proper grammatical structure. Whenever I read my girlfriend’s papers (shes a very good writer), she writes like how she talks; but, when I write, I only know a few sentence structures and I don’t know how to write how I think. When I think sentences in my head, there are run on sentences and improper sentences, so I don’t know how to create my natural voice using proper grammar.\n\nWrite down three things that have confused you, or that you don’t fully understand about essay writing (or reading), and have your list ready by the start of our class on Thursday.\n\n\n- How to convey voice with proper grammar\n\n\n- How to flow from the introduction to the background to the thesis\n\n\n- How to have proper flow during the body paragraph to the topic sentences to the thesis\n\n\n\nDue by the start of class on Tuesday, 9/12\n\nReflect upon Elizabeth Kübler-Ross and David Kessler’s articles, and on the cycle stress, grief, and behavior that Kessler discusses. Consider how adding positive things to your life every day could help to reduce stress levels, which in turn could reduce symptoms of grief, and positively affect our behavior and our life experience\nMake notes of your reflections, as these will be useful to you for our next essay!"

    "text": "Story Time:\nOne upon a time, in a far far away land called the United Kingdom (or Britain I don’t know the difference), Professor Drew Borland was a young leather-jacketed punk. At the prime age of 17, Professor Drew tried to buy a book or something using his checking account.\nHe didn’t know if he had enough money in his account to buy the book, but he risked it and bought the book anyways. Unfortunately for Professor Drew, he did not have enough money in his checking account, and he ended up over drafting.\nExpecting a lecture from the Banking Man, Professor Drew mentally braced himself. However, instead of a harsh lecturing, the bank man ended up telling him that the bank still wanted him because one day, Professor Drew would make money, and one day, he will deposit his money at that bank.\nIn the end, the Banking Man gave Professor Drew a loan to buy his books, and forgave Professor Drew for over drafting, which was a crime in the United Kingdom at the time. The Banking Man told him that, had Professor Drew spoken to the Bank Man sooner, he could have had a loan and not over drafted in the first place.\nThe moral of this story is, students should reach out to Professor Borland if they are struggling economically to buy A Pocket Style Manual 9th Edition by Diana Hacker and Nancy Sommers. Little do my classmates know, you can download an online PDF here.\n\n\nHandkerchief Notes:\nIf you are trying to remember something, Professor Drew recommends setting constant alarms and snoozing them. Then, only after completing the thing, you can stop the alarm.\nPeople in the olden days, in a far-far away land called the United Kingdom, people would knot their handkerchiefs to remember things. Then, they would grab their handkerchief and think, “What? Why is my handkerchief tied? Oh yeah! It’s because I was supposed to do this!”\n\n\nWhat we did in class today\n\nBreakout Group 1: \nWith respect to the Covid pandemic, David Kessler interprets grief as “the loss of normalcy; [e.g.] the fear of economic toll, and the loss of connection”. Discuss which aspects of a “loss of normalcy” you can personally identify with and discuss how these and other aspects of the loss of normalcy have affected you since the start of the pandemic. Make notes of your findings.\n\n\nBreakout Group 2: \nKessler identifies “anticipatory grief” and defines this as ”[feelings of stress] we get about what the future holds when we’re uncertain”. Discuss the aspects of “anticipatory grief” that you can personally identify with since the start of the pandemic, and how these aspects of anticipatory grief have affected you. Make notes of your findings.\n\n\nBreakout Group 3: \nIn the article “That Discomfort You’re Feeling is Grief”, David Kessler refers to Elizabeth Kübler-Ross’s “Five Stages of Grief”: denial; anger; bargaining; sadness, and acceptance, and Kessler proposes that the key to managing our stress lies within acceptance.\n1) Discuss and make notes on the specific things you are already doing voluntarily that involve acceptance of the Covid-19 crisis (e.g. hand washing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, getting vaccinated, taking classes online [if this is not against your will], being more patient with friends and family, etc.), and discuss what additional positive things you are doing that follow from your acceptance of the pandemic. Make notes of your findings.\nNote: things you are beingforced to do against your will do not count as acceptance (e.g. against your will having to move back home, give up your job, or move to online learning [if this is against your will], etc.). Acceptance only occurs when you do something by choice, even though it may be unpleasant and unwelcome.\n2) Discuss and make notes on whether you agree with Kessler that reducing our own stress comes from gaining control over our situations, and that acceptance is a vital aspect of this. Do you agree with him? Make notes of your findings.\n\n\nBreakout Group 4: \nKessler talks about the importance of finding “a balance in the things you’re thinking”. He suggests that we don’t try to completely block out all of the painful images and fears we encounter, but he suggests instead we work to find ways to balance negative thoughts with positive thoughts and images.\nDiscuss and make notes on the following:\n\nAre you are consciously making time in your days to do things that are likely to foster and create positive thoughts and images?\nWhat techniques are you using now?\nWhat positive-thinking techniques could you use that you are not currently using?\nCan we reduce the negative images and thoughts we have, without trying to completely block them out? What kinds of things could we reduce, or cut back on in our lives in order to achieve this?\nDo you agree with David Kessler that we all need to work hard to find a way to balance the incessant flood of negative images and thoughts we all encounter, with more positive ones? \n\n\n\n\nWhat I did Today\nI was in group 3, and I said that we accepted COVID at the start because we liked not having to get ready for school and be judged for what we wear, but we rejected needing to show our cameras, some of us wearing masks, and one of us had mandated uniforms during Zoom.\nWe unanimously agreed that stress is proportional to the amount of control someone has over a situation. If you have a lot of control over a situation, it isn’t as stressful. If you got into a car accident, but you had a lot of money, then you wouldn’t be as stressed because you have control and know you can pay it off. If you didn’t have enough money, then its stressful because you don’t have as much control. Maybe you will have to get a loan, and what if you cant pay it off?\nBy this logic, acceptance of peril helps reduce stress because it gives you more control. If you accept that peril will happen, it gives you time to prepare and control the situation, and this reduces stress."

I used to do this when I lived in San Diego, but after moving I haven’t had the chance. Maybe I should buy a water bottle and refill it frequently, because then I wouldn’t have to pay for plastic water bottles anymore and it would be cheaper.\n\nDescribe how and why you think adding this one thing will create positive energy for you.\n\nI think this would create positivity because water has many health benefits and also tastes very good. It can help me wake up in the morning, it will save money, and it will help the environment which SF I’m pretty sure is very environmentally proactive.\n\nIf you are already incorporating positive things into your everyday routine to add positive energy, please describe these and describe the effect these activities have on the way you feel.\n\nOne thing I do to make my days more positive already is to keep myself as organized as possible with my meetings and appointments. I have been keeping my things in Google Calendar to remind me of my classes and obligations, so I can keep them all from overlapping.\n\n\nNotes\n\nPlease make sure you complete this homework before the start of our next Zoom class, as we will be using the results in our Zoom class on September 5.\nI am not collecting this homework. The only thing you are submitting to me (by email) is your textbook proof of purchase. You are not submitting anything to Canvas this week."
