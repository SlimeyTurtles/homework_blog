    "text": "Story Time:\nOne upon a time, in a far far away land called the United Kingdom (or Britain I don’t know the difference), Professor Drew Borland was a young leather-jacketed punk. At the prime age of 17, Professor Drew tried to buy a book or something using his checking account.\nHe didn’t know if he had enough money in his account to buy the book, but he risked it and bought the book anyways. Unfortunately for Professor Drew, he did not have enough money in his checking account, and he ended up over drafting.\nExpecting a lecture from the Banking Man, Professor Drew mentally braced himself. However, instead of a harsh lecturing, the bank man ended up telling him that the bank still wanted him because one day, Professor Drew would make money, and one day, he will deposit his money at that bank.\nIn the end, the Banking Man gave Professor Drew a loan to buy his books, and forgave Professor Drew for over drafting, which was a crime in the United Kingdom at the time. The Banking Man told him that, had Professor Drew spoken to the Bank Man sooner, he could have had a loan and not over drafted in the first place.\nThe moral of this story is, students should reach out to Professor Borland if they are struggling economically to buy A Pocket Style Manual 9th Edition by Diana Hacker and Nancy Sommers. Little do my classmates know, you can download an online PDF here.\n\n\nHandkerchief Notes:\nIf you are trying to remember something, Professor Drew recommends setting constant alarms and snoozing them. Then, only after completing the thing, you can stop the alarm.\nPeople in the olden days, in a far-far away land called the United Kingdom, people would knot their handkerchiefs to remember things. Then, they would grab their handkerchief and think, “What? Why is my handkerchief tied? Oh yeah! It’s because I was supposed to do this!”\n\n\nWhat we did in class today\n\nBreakout Group 1: \nWith respect to the Covid pandemic, David Kessler interprets grief as “the loss of normalcy; [e.g.] the fear of economic toll, and the loss of connection”. Discuss which aspects of a “loss of normalcy” you can personally identify with and discuss how these and other aspects of the loss of normalcy have affected you since the start of the pandemic. Make notes of your findings.\n\n\nBreakout Group 2: \nKessler identifies “anticipatory grief” and defines this as ”[feelings of stress] we get about what the future holds when we’re uncertain”. Discuss the aspects of “anticipatory grief” that you can personally identify with since the start of the pandemic, and how these aspects of anticipatory grief have affected you. Make notes of your findings.\n\n\nBreakout Group 3: \nIn the article “That Discomfort You’re Feeling is Grief”, David Kessler refers to Elizabeth Kübler-Ross’s “Five Stages of Grief”: denial; anger; bargaining; sadness, and acceptance, and Kessler proposes that the key to managing our stress lies within acceptance.\n1) Discuss and make notes on the specific things you are already doing voluntarily that involve acceptance of the Covid-19 crisis (e.g. hand washing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, getting vaccinated, taking classes online [if this is not against your will], being more patient with friends and family, etc.), and discuss what additional positive things you are doing that follow from your acceptance of the pandemic. Make notes of your findings.\nNote: things you are beingforced to do against your will do not count as acceptance (e.g. against your will having to move back home, give up your job, or move to online learning [if this is against your will], etc.). Acceptance only occurs when you do something by choice, even though it may be unpleasant and unwelcome.\n2) Discuss and make notes on whether you agree with Kessler that reducing our own stress comes from gaining control over our situations, and that acceptance is a vital aspect of this. Do you agree with him? Make notes of your findings.\n\n\nBreakout Group 4: \nKessler talks about the importance of finding “a balance in the things you’re thinking”. He suggests that we don’t try to completely block out all of the painful images and fears we encounter, but he suggests instead we work to find ways to balance negative thoughts with positive thoughts and images.\nDiscuss and make notes on the following:\n\nAre you are consciously making time in your days to do things that are likely to foster and create positive thoughts and images?\nWhat techniques are you using now?\nWhat positive-thinking techniques could you use that you are not currently using?\nCan we reduce the negative images and thoughts we have, without trying to completely block them out? What kinds of things could we reduce, or cut back on in our lives in order to achieve this?\nDo you agree with David Kessler that we all need to work hard to find a way to balance the incessant flood of negative images and thoughts we all encounter, with more positive ones? \n\n\n\n\nWhat I did Today\nI was in group 3, and I said that we accepted COVID at the start because we liked not having to get ready for school and be judged for what we wear, but we rejected needing to show our cameras, some of us wearing masks, and one of us had mandated uniforms during Zoom.\nWe unanimously agreed that stress is proportional to the amount of control someone has over a situation. If you have a lot of control over a situation, it isn’t as stressful. If you got into a car accident, but you had a lot of money, then you wouldn’t be as stressed because you have control and know you can pay it off. If you didn’t have enough money, then its stressful because you don’t have as much control. Maybe you will have to get a loan, and what if you cant pay it off?\nBy this logic, acceptance of peril helps reduce stress because it gives you more control. If you accept that peril will happen, it gives you time to prepare and control the situation, and this reduces stress."

    "text": "Due by the start of class on Thursday, 9/7\n\nHave you ever been puzzled or confused by something about essay writing, or writing in general? Now is your chance to find out answers to your questions!\n\nI struggle a lot with the flow of a paper and proper grammatical structure. Whenever I read my girlfriend’s papers (shes a very good writer), she writes like how she talks; but, when I write, I only know a few sentence structures and I don’t know how to write how I think. When I think sentences in my head, there are run on sentences and improper sentences, so I don’t know how to create my natural voice using proper grammar.\n\nWrite down three things that have confused you, or that you don’t fully understand about essay writing (or reading), and have your list ready by the start of our class on Thursday.\n\n\n- How to convey voice with proper grammar\n\n\n- How to flow from the introduction to the background to the thesis\n\n\n- How to have proper flow during the body paragraph to the topic sentences to the thesis\n\n\n\nDue by the start of class on Tuesday, 9/12\n\nReflect upon Elizabeth Kübler-Ross and David Kessler’s articles, and on the cycle stress, grief, and behavior that Kessler discusses. Consider how adding positive things to your life every day could help to reduce stress levels, which in turn could reduce symptoms of grief, and positively affect our behavior and our life experience\nMake notes of your reflections, as these will be useful to you for our next essay!"

    "text": "Due September 5th, 2023 (Tuesday)\n\n\nLink to assignment\n\n\nHomework\n\nPlease send me an email with proof of purchase of the required textbook, “A Pocket Style Manual (9th Edition)”.\nComplete a Pre-Reading Worksheet for each of the two articles.\n\nKübler-Ross “Five Stages of Grief” (1969) Pre-Reading Worksheet\n“That Discomfort You’re Feeling Is Grief” Pre-Reading Worksheet\n\nRead and annotate the two articles (located in Class Resources).\nWrite down one new thing you can add to your daily routine that will add positive, or peaceful energy to your mind.\n\nOne thing I want to start doing consistently is drinking water every morning. I used to do this when I lived in San Diego, but after moving I haven’t had the chance. Maybe I should buy a water bottle and refill it frequently, because then I wouldn’t have to pay for plastic water bottles anymore and it would be cheaper.\n\nDescribe how and why you think adding this one thing will create positive energy for you.\n\nI think this would create positivity because water has many health benefits and also tastes very good. It can help me wake up in the morning, it will save money, and it will help the environment which SF I’m pretty sure is very environmentally proactive.\n\nIf you are already incorporating positive things into your everyday routine to add positive energy, please describe these and describe the effect these activities have on the way you feel.\n\nOne thing I do to make my days more positive already is to keep myself as organized as possible with my meetings and appointments. I have been keeping my things in Google Calendar to remind me of my classes and obligations, so I can keep them all from overlapping.\n\n\nNotes\n\nPlease make sure you complete this homework before the start of our next Zoom class, as we will be using the results in our Zoom class on September 5.\nI am not collecting this homework. The only thing you are submitting to me (by email) is your textbook proof of purchase. You are not submitting anything to Canvas this week."
